The state of India is becoming more and more fascistic and authoritarian with Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party in power, which has emboldened Hindu fascism (Hindutva). We see this in the increase of incidents of violence against Dalits, Muslims, and Adivasis, and other religious and caste minorities, along with the recent abrogation of Article 370 and 35A, resulting in the increased occupation and militarization of Kashmir. We see this in the recently imposed statelessness of over 3 million Bengali Muslims, and the recent Islamaphobic citizenship bill that has banned Muslims from immigrating to India. We see this is the casteist violence that pervades the country everyday through lynchings and mob violence. You might be asking what surveillance has to do with the rise of Hindu fascism."
export const INTRO_PAGE_2 = "Alongside the rise of Hindutva, we also see a rise in surveillance through biometrics with Aadhaar, facial recognition technology, and government interception of phones, computers, and networks. Surveillance is often said to be a way to protect people, but we must ask: which people? Surveillance is fundamentally about power and domination as it always seeks to control and police. As surveillance scholar Jasbir Puar says, surveillance is also pre-emptive: it seeks to control now, so that it can avoid having to repress later. Because surveillance is about power, it is intertwined deeply with Brahmanical hegemony, capitalism, patriarchy, and heterosexuality, which means those who are most deeply surveilled are those who are the most marginalized. With the rapid development of technology, however, surveillance becomes an issue for all of us to be concerned about, as it jeopardizes our right to privacy, autonomy, individual identity, and for many, their very lives."
export const INTRO_PAGE_3 = "In this timeline, I hope to make the argument that the rise of surveillance in India has helped embolden the rise of far-right Hindu fascism and that British colonialism laid the groundwork for those surveillance tactics and logics through their white supremacist colonial agenda. I do this through the use of archival pictures, videos, and documents that you can explore and interact with. At the very end, I hope to counter the grim conditions of Hindu fascism with anti-surveillance futures. I amplify the work of those on the frontlines of those fight, who are often Dalit and Muslim feminists and Ambedkarites."
